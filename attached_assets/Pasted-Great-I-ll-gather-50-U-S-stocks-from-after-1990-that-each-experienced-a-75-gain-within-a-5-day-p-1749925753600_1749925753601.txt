Great. I’ll gather 50 U.S. stocks from after 1990 that each experienced a 75%+ gain within a 5-day period. For each, I’ll include the ticker, sector, date range of the surge, percentage gain, detailed price data, catalysts, technical indicators (including RSI), notable volume patterns, and relevant news sources—covering the two weeks prior, the week of the gain, and the week after.

I’ll let you know once the full dataset and insights are ready for review.
